# TechMagicHw6-7

This project is a small web application that consists of two parts. In the first task, the users will be fetched locally, and in the second - from the REST API. You can search for certain information about users, select some of them by clicking on the flags, delete them or select all, and in the second task - additionally create new users. This feature is built with forms and validation. There is also a search by name and the ability to sort users by first name or last name in the first task and set the order of sorting by name in the second.
